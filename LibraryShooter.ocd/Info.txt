[Developer/Maintainer]
Marky 

[Folder Information]
This folder contains objects that can be used for shooter scenarios games. 

[Information for developers]
Since this is a library, the folder should contain only objects that are useful for everyone, or base objects that can be included. Think 'abstract' functions in other programming languages.
The implementation of these objects for specific packs should be done in those packs.

If you want to contribute to this folder feel free to do so and in case of questions contact the maintainer
in IRC or the forum.
